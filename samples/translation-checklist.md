**From "The Art of Prompting: Everyday Guide for AI-Powered Translations" by Ekaterina Markova**

---

## 1. Before You Start Translating
- [ ] Clarify source and target languages
- [ ] Identify domain and subject area
- [ ] Define the target audience (e.g. specialists, general public, children)
- [ ] Gather any required glossaries or style guides
- [ ] Check for any client or project-specific instructions
- [ ] Decide on desired tone and register

---

## 2. Preparing the Prompt
- [ ] Clearly specify the role for the model (e.g. professional translator, legal expert)
- [ ] Include subject/domain in the prompt
- [ ] Mention terminology or glossary requirements
- [ ] State style and formatting preferences
- [ ] Provide additional context if needed
- [ ] Ask for clarification if anything is ambiguous in the source text

---

## 3. Running the Translation
- [ ] Use the correct prompt template for text type (technical, legal, conversational, etc.)
- [ ] Double-check language and formatting settings in your AI tool
- [ ] If the translation is long, consider chunking the text and using long-context window instructions
- [ ] Specify output format if needed (plain text, table, etc.)

---

## 4. Reviewing the Result
- [ ] Read through the full translation without source text first
- [ ] Compare segments with the source for meaning accuracy
- [ ] Check for omitted, added, or mistranslated segments
- [ ] Verify terminology, especially for key terms and acronyms
- [ ] Ensure style and register match instructions
- [ ] Review formatting (lists, tables, numbering, headings)

---

## 5. Post-Editing & Fact-Checking
- [ ] Fact-check names, numbers, dates, factual content
- [ ] Double-check proper nouns and references
- [ ] Validate client or regulatory requirements are met
- [ ] Check for AI-specific errors (hallucinations, repeated words, loss of structure)
- [ ] Apply additional post-editing as needed for publication or client delivery

---

## 6. Final Steps
- [ ] Run grammar and spell check
- [ ] Review target text for clarity and fluency
- [ ] Ask: Does the result sound natural for a native speaker?
- [ ] Save final files in required formats
- [ ] Prepare delivery/hand-off with any necessary notes for the client
